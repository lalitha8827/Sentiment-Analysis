The main idea of this project is to count the number of positive reviews and number of negative reviews of a product with the help of a machine learning model.
If the reviews are more than 1000,the top 1000 reviews are considered for counting.
The wordcloud of all these reviews can also be viewed here.
we have enter the url of the product from flipkart website,then it counts the reviews and displays them ,also it shows the details like product name,product price,product overall rating,customer name,custmer rating,comment head and the customer comments and the wordcloud of the reviews in the form of a table.
If the reviews are more than 80,then the table shows the top 80 details.
